# Final Semester Project: Android Application Development with Android Studio

## Overview
For your final project, you will build a fully functional Android application using Android Studio and Jetpack Compose. This project will integrate all the skills and concepts you have learned over the semester, including UI design, layout, navigation, data storage, and interaction with Android device capabilities. Your app should provide a seamless, user-friendly experience and demonstrate thoughtful design and programming practices.

## Project Objectives

1. **Application Concept and Requirements:**
   - Select a project idea from the list below or propose your own (subject to approval).
   - Define the primary purpose of your app and its intended audience.
   - Outline at least three core features that your app will include.

2. **Design and User Experience (UX):**
   - Design an intuitive user interface (UI) using Jetpack Compose.
   - Incorporate navigation between multiple screens.
   - Ensure responsive layouts that work across different screen sizes and orientations.
   - Include a color scheme, typography, and styling that enhance usability and align with your app's theme.

3. **Core Features and Functionality:**
   - Implement the primary functionality you outlined in your project proposal. For example:
     - **Social app:** Profile creation, messaging, and friend requests.
     - **Fitness app:** Tracking workouts, goals, and health statistics.
     - **To-do app:** Creating, updating, and managing tasks with deadlines.
   - Include data persistence using Room database, SharedPreferences, or other storage methods.
   - Utilize Android-specific capabilities, such as camera access, geolocation, or notifications, where appropriate.

4. **Code Quality and Documentation:**
   - Use organized, readable code following best practices for Android development.
   - Include inline comments to explain complex sections of code.
   - Submit brief documentation explaining how to use your app, its key features, and any setup required.

5. **Extra Credit Opportunities (Optional):**
   - Integrate external APIs (e.g., weather, maps, news).
   - Implement advanced features such as push notifications, animations, or widgets.
   - Add support for multiple languages or accessibility features.

## Project Milestones

- **Week 1-2:** Project proposal submission and feedback.
- **Week 3-6:** Development of core features and UI screens.
- **Week 7-8:** Integration of additional features, testing, and troubleshooting.
- **Week 9:** Final app polish, code review, and documentation completion.
- **Final Submission Date:** [Specify due date]

## Submission Requirements

- Completed Android Studio project folder with source code.
- A video demonstration (2-3 minutes) showcasing app features.
- Written documentation detailing the appâ€™s purpose, features, and any setup instructions.

## Grading Criteria

1. **Concept & Creativity:** Originality and clarity of the app idea.
2. **UI/UX Design:** Layout, navigation, visual appeal, and user experience.
3. **Functionality:** How well the core features work as intended.
4. **Technical Complexity:** Use of Android capabilities, data storage, and Jetpack Compose.
5. **Code Quality & Documentation:** Code structure, readability, and helpful documentation.

## Project Ideas

1. **Social App:** Build a social networking app where users can connect, share, and chat.
2. **Fitness Tracker:** Track user workouts, progress, and fitness goals.
3. **Budgeting App:** Help users manage expenses and income, with budgeting categories.
4. **To-Do App:** Allow users to create, edit, and complete tasks with reminders.
