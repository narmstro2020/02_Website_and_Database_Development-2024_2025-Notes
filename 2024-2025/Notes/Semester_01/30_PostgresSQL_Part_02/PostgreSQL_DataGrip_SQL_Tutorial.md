## 5. Reading Data from Tables

- **Select all records**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users;
  ```

- **Select specific columns**:

  ```sql
  SELECT username, email FROM users;
  ```

- **Filtering records** with `WHERE`:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users 
  WHERE username = 'john_doe';
  ```

- **Ordering results**:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC;
  ```

## 6. Updating Data in Tables

- Update a recordâ€™s data:

  ```sql
  UPDATE users 
  SET email = 'john.updated@example.com' 
  WHERE username = 'john_doe';
  ```

- Update multiple fields:

  ```sql
  UPDATE users 
  SET email = 'jane.updated@example.com', username = 'jane_updated' 
  WHERE user_id = 2;
  ```
