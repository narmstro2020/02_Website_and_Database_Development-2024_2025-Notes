# Project: Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview
In this project, students will create a personal portfolio website to showcase their skills, interests, and any work they have completed in class. This will help students practice foundational HTML and CSS concepts while building a website they can potentially use for future projects or job applications.

## Learning Objectives
- Build a multi-page website using HTML and CSS.
- Apply principles of responsive design.
- Understand and implement basic CSS styling techniques.
- Practice layout techniques, including flexbox and grid.
- Enhance the user experience with navigation and thoughtful design choices.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Website Structure
The site should have at least three pages:
- **Home Page:** Introduces the student and their interests.
- **Portfolio Page:** Showcases any completed projects or assignments.
- **Contact Page:** Provides a way for people to reach the student (could be a simple form).

### 2. HTML Content
- Use a variety of HTML elements such as headers, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
- Include semantic elements (like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) for better organization and accessibility.
- Ensure that all images have appropriate `alt` attributes for accessibility.

### 3. CSS Styling
- Create a visually appealing layout using CSS.
- Style elements using properties like colors, fonts, borders, and spacing (margins/padding).
- Apply flexbox or grid to arrange sections and items within pages.
- Implement consistent styling across pages using an external stylesheet.

### 4. Responsive Design
- Ensure the website is responsive and looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- Use media queries to adjust the layout and font sizes based on screen size.

### 5. Navigation
- Include a navigation bar on each page with links to all other pages.
- Ensure the navigation is clear, easy to use, and accessible.

### 6. Additional Features
- **Typography:** Use different font styles for headers and paragraphs to improve readability.
- **Hover Effects:** Add hover effects to buttons and links for visual feedback.
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox Layouts:** Organize content sections, especially in the portfolio page, using grid or flexbox for a clean, modern look.

## Project Guidelines
- **File Structure:** Organize files into folders (e.g., a folder for images, CSS files, etc.).
- **Comments:** Add comments in both HTML and CSS files to explain your code.
- **Naming Conventions:** Use meaningful class and ID names that describe the content or function.

## Grading Criteria
- **HTML Structure & Semantics**: Proper HTML5 structure, use of semantic elements.
- **CSS Styling & Consistency**: Effective use of CSS properties, adherence to design principles, and overall aesthetic quality.
- **Responsiveness**: Ability to display well across multiple devices.
- **Navigation**: Functionality and user-friendly experience.
- **Creativity & Personalization**: Students are encouraged to bring their personal style to the project.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2:** Set up project files, create a basic structure, and begin building the Home Page.
- **Week 3-4:** Work on the Portfolio and Contact Pages, and style all pages.
- **Week 5:** Finalize responsive design, add finishing touches, and conduct peer reviews.
- **Week 6:** Present and submit the final project.
